## Introduction

No matter what you create, getting exposure is hard. Unless you benefit from an established network or spend a lot of time advertising, it is highly likely that your creation will remain unknown. This is true in all fields, and open-source development is no exception.

GitHub "stars" can be an indicator of popularity but in no way an indicator of quality. There are countless high-quality repositories that get very few stars and, since most open-source project discovery mechanisms (e.g., [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore)) sort the projects by the number of stars, the highlighted projects are not necessarily the most interesting.

Unstar aims to improve the discoverability of JavaScript libraries, tools, and resources, by using humans instead of algorithms.
